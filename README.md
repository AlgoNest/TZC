# TeamZone Coin (TZC)

TeamZone Coin (TZC) is the **demo SaaS token** for the TeamZone ecosystem.  
It represents the idea of having a native cryptocurrency that powers TeamZone’s SaaS platform — built on top of blockchain technology.  

This repo is **not about launching a coin right now**. Instead, it provides a **minimal yet professional ERC-20 project** to showcase the concept, serve as a proof-of-work for our vision, and demonstrate our technical foundation.

## 🌍 Why TZC?
TeamZone is a SaaS platform built for teams, communities, and productivity.  
The idea behind TZC is to introduce a token that could one day support:

- 🎁 **Rewards & Gamification** – Reward users for activity, achievements, or contributions.  
- 💎 **Premium SaaS Features** – Unlock advanced TeamZone tools using TZC.  
- 🤝 **Community Incentives** – Encourage collaboration and growth through token-based incentives.  
- 🌐 **Integration Possibilities** – Future integration with wallets, DeFi, or partner services.  

Think of TZC as the **native utility coin** of the TeamZone ecosystem.
