# TeamZone Coin (TZC)

TeamZone Coin (TZC) is the **SaaS token** for the TeamZone ecosystem.  
It’s a minimal ERC-20 token project built with Solidity and Hardhat, serving as a **proof of concept** for how blockchain could integrate with TeamZone SaaS products.  

---

## Why TZC?
TeamZone is building SaaS solutions for teams and communities.  
TZC is envisioned as the native coin that could support:
- Reward systems  
- Premium SaaS features  
- Community-driven incentives  

This repo is **not a live deployment** — it’s for demonstration and exploration.
